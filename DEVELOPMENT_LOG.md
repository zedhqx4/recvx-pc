# Development Log — GS Rebuild

This log records the staged reconstruction of the PC port from the clean `pc-port` baseline.
Changes are recorded chronologically, with working fixes kept separate from diagnostics and
experiments. Each step should remain small enough to build, test, and either retain or revert
independently.

## Working Rules

- Keep `pc-port` unchanged; all reconstruction work belongs on `experimental/gs-rebuild`.
- Restore known-good fixes selectively. Do not merge entire experimental branches.
- Separate required compatibility fixes, correctness fixes, diagnostics, and performance experiments.
- For each step, record the hypothesis, source/reference commit, files changed, validation performed,
  and outcome.
- Do not describe a change as validated until it has been built and exercised in the game.

## 2026-11-01 — Step 1: Reserve the PS2 Scratchpad Before OpenGL Initialization

**Category:** Startup / address-space compatibility fix  
**Status:** Implemented; runtime validation pending  
**Reference:** `experimental/videofixing` commit `d5bfca1`  
**Implementation commit on this branch:** `0d084e8`

### Problem

The game requires its PS2 scratchpad at the fixed virtual address `0x70000000`.
The previous PC startup sequence created the SDL window and OpenGL context before reserving
that address range. Loading the graphics driver can occupy the required range, causing the
scratchpad allocation to fail during startup.

### Change

In `pc/src/pc_platform.c`, `pcVideoInit()` now reserves the scratchpad immediately after
successful `SDL_Init()`, before creating the window or OpenGL context.

The resulting order is:

1. Install diagnostics and initialize SDL.
2. Reserve the PS2 scratchpad at `0x70000000`.
3. Configure OpenGL and load video settings.
4. Create the SDL window and OpenGL context.
5. Initialize the GS renderer with the previously reserved scratchpad.

The allocation failure remains an explicit fatal startup error. This change moves the reservation
earlier; it does not guarantee that the address range is available on every Windows process layout.

### Files Changed

- `pc/src/pc_platform.c`
  - Added a function-scope scratchpad pointer in `pcVideoInit()`.
  - Moved `pcOsAllocScratchpad()` before window/context creation.
  - Passed the reserved pointer to `pcGsInit()` after the OpenGL context is ready.

No GS memory, texture-cache, VRAM, renderer, or game texture-management logic was changed.

### Validation

- **Source review:** Confirmed the change is limited to `pc/src/pc_platform.c`.
- **Branch comparison:** At implementation commit `0d084e8`, the branch differed from
  `pc-port` only in that file.
- **Build:** Not yet verified.
- **Runtime startup:** Not yet verified.
- **Game/scene regression:** Not yet verified.

### Next Checkpoint

Build this branch and launch the executable. Confirm that scratchpad reservation succeeds before
OpenGL initialization and that `pcGsInit(spr)` completes. If reservation fails, capture the
startup log and inspect the address-space diagnostic before changing the allocation strategy.

## 2026-11-01 — Step 2: Migrate the Clean PC Port to SDL3

**Category:** Platform / dependency migration  
**Status:** Implemented; Windows build and runtime validation pending  
**Reference migration:** `SDL3` branch commit `d9497ce`  
**Additional SDL3 ownership correction:** `SDL3` branch commit `3eee5d1`  
**Implementation commit on this branch:** `2bbe52c`

### Scope and Rationale

Move the clean PC port from SDL 2.32.10 to SDL 3.4.18 before continuing the GS memory reconstruction.
The existing SDL3 branch was not cherry-picked because its ancestry includes the `graphics-fixes`
work. Instead, the SDL3 API and build changes were selectively ported onto this branch, preserving
the scratchpad fix and leaving graphics/renderer experiments out.

SDL3 Gamepad support and the HIDAPI/libusb build configuration were retained so the Wii U GameCube
adapter path remains available for later controller testing.

### Changes

- Updated window, display, event, cursor, threading, and Gamepad APIs for SDL3.
- Replaced the SDL2 audio-device callback with an SDL3 audio stream callback while retaining the
  existing float stereo mixer and voice/resampling logic.
- Updated the settings application to SDL3 display-mode and Gamepad APIs.
- Updated OpenGL integration to include SDL3 headers and use
  `SDL_GetWindowSizeInPixels()` instead of the removed drawable-size API.
- Updated the build to use SDL 3.4.18, build SDL from source with HIDAPI/libusb enabled, link
  `SDL3.lib`, and package `SDL3.dll` plus `libusb-1.0.dll`.
- Updated the Windows workflow to run on `experimental/gs-rebuild`, verify the SDL3 runtime DLLs,
  and include both DLLs in the branch/commit-named artifact.
- Fixed SDL3 base-path ownership: `SDL_GetBasePath()` returns SDL-owned cached data, so
  `pcPlatformExeDir()` no longer calls `SDL_free()` on it.

### Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`
- `README.md`
- `pc/config/recvx_config.c`
- `pc/src/gs/gl_funcs.h`
- `pc/src/gs/gs_gl.c`
- `pc/src/pc_audio.c`
- `pc/src/pc_platform.c`
- `pc/tools/build.py`
- `pc/tools/fetch_deps.py`

### Explicitly Excluded

The migration deliberately does **not** bring across the unrelated `graphics-fixes` work:
custom internal resolution, UV crop/tuning and font fixes, UI wireframe diagnostics, or configurable
VSync. It also does not import GS VRAM, texture-cache, render-target, movie, or frame-rate
optimizations from `alpha` or `performance-sdl3`.

The scratchpad reservation remains immediately after successful `SDL_Init()` and before
`SDL_CreateWindow()` / OpenGL context creation.

### Validation

- **Source review:** The SDL3 migration was applied to the nine files listed above.
- **Static checks:** Confirmed SDL 3.4.18 dependency selection, SDL3 audio-stream/Gamepad APIs,
  SDL3 event names, absence of the checked SDL2 API/link symbols, and SDL3 runtime DLL packaging.
- **Scratchpad order:** Confirmed `pcOsAllocScratchpad()` remains before `SDL_CreateWindow()`.
- **Branch comparison:** This migration commit changes only the nine files listed above relative
  to the preceding log commit.
- **Windows build:** Not yet verified.
- **Startup smoke test:** Not yet verified.
- **Audio, keyboard/mouse, controller, GameCube adapter and in-game regression:** Not yet verified.

### Next Checkpoint

Run the Windows Actions build from `experimental/gs-rebuild`. Confirm that it builds SDL3 and
libusb, links both executables, and packages `SDL3.dll` and `libusb-1.0.dll`. Then launch the game
and verify the scratchpad reservation, SDL window/OpenGL startup, audio playback, and basic input
before restoring any graphics or GS changes.
